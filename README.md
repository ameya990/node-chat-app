# node-chat-app
This is a bidirectional chat application.

I have rewritten the front-end in react. 
STEPS TO RUN: 
-------------
1. Open the "bidirect-chat-app" folder in your favorite IDE (I use VS Code).
2. Open a new terminal at this location and type "nodemon server.js".
3. The above step will run the server on "localhost:9000".If you wish, you can navigate to this URL and check out the original Front-End developed while I was taking a tutorial on Lynda.com by Alexander Zanfir.
4. Fire up another instance of your favorite IDE and open the "bidirect-chat-app\client" folder. I have written the React front-end code in here.
5. Open a new terminal at this location and type "npm start".
6. The above step will run the React App at "localhost:3000". This typically happens automatically. 

Any suggestions / feedback are more than welcome. Cheerios!

Initially, the source code here was developed following the Lynda.com tutorial by Alexander Zanfir. Now I intend to extend and modify this application to progressively make it a more complete "end to end" bespoke chat application.
